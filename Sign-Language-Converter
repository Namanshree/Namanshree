# Sign Language to Text Converter

### 🎯 Objective
This project is a real-time system designed to translate hand gestures from a webcam feed into readable text, enabling smoother communication for individuals with hearing or speech impairments.

### ✨ Key Features
* **Real-Time Translation:** Processes webcam input and provides live text output in under 0.5 seconds per gesture.
* **High Accuracy:** Achieves 95% gesture recognition accuracy using a custom-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model.

### 🛠️ Technologies Used
* **Python**
* **TensorFlow & Keras:** For building and training the CNN model.
* **OpenCV:** For video capture and image processing from the webcam feed.

### 📈 Results
The final model delivered a highly accurate and near real-time user experience, successfully bridging a critical communication gap. The system's efficiency makes it practical for daily use.
